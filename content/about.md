>Me thinking about the latest hyped AI technology!

I'm a cloud/software architect and engineer with a focus on security. I've worked for over 15 years in tech, starting from the hardware side of Silicon Valley to building software orgs from the ground up in a wide range of industries/tech (SaaS, crypto, logistics, mobile, e-commerce, defence, big-data, gen AI/ML, etc.). I've held roles from engineer to CTO and have seen the good, bad, and the ugly of building technology systems and orgs.

## What I do

I help companies optimise for their business goals while building secure, scalable, and resilient systems. I approach problems with a business mindset but dive into deep tech as needed. This means working end to end from defining business objectives to actually designing and implementing cloud infrastructure and hardening them against the latest threats. 

Examples:
- Design DevSecOps and secure CI/CD process 
- Help companies migrate on-prem systems to cloud providers
- Expand and harden infrastructure to support high availability while reducing costs
- Meet regulatory requirements and audit standards in a remote/global workforce environment (GDPR, ISO, SOC2, etc.)
- Select the best platforms and cloud products to meet business objectives, minimise costs, and reduce risk (e.g. data warehouse and serverless product selection on Google, AWS, Azure, etc.)
- ...and more!
